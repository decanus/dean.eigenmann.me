Currently I am the founder of [Soapbox](https://soapbox.social), I also co-founded [dialectic](http://dialectic.ch/) and occasionally review pull-requests for [ens](https://ens.domains).

I am interested in distributed systems and write a [newsletter](/newsletter/) on them. I read lots of papers, and occasionally [summarize them](https://github.com/decanus/research/). Most of my work can be found on [github](https://github.com/decanus/).
