# Hey!

I am a researcher at [vac](https://vac.dev) ([status](https://status.im)). I also work on [ens](https://ens.domains) as a developer.
I am interested in distributed systems and write a [newsletter](https://distsys.substack.com/) on them.
I try to do my research transparently on [github](github.com/decanus/research). I enjoy reading lots of [papers](/papers-i-read/),
and occasionally [summarize them](https://github.com/decanus/research/issues/10).

Previously I worked as a security researcher at [ZK Labs](https://zklabs.io/) and as a developer at [brack.ch](https://brack.ch).
I started my software development career with an internship at [spacebyte](https://spacebyte.com/).
